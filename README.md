# Efficient Dynamic Indexing for Range Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search

This repository implements a dynamic indexing (RangePQ+) for range filtered approximate nearest neighbor search. Given an object set, each object represents a vector with an associated attribute value. Range filtered ANN search contains a query range $Q=[l,r]$. The query can be viewed as, ANN search only for those vectors whose attribute values are in the particular range $Q$.

## Features of RangePQ+
- Fast and memory efficient range filtered ANN.
- RangePQ+ support efficiently insert and delete object.
- RangePQ+ is a lightweight index scheme.
